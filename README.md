The past few years has seen fairly wide adoption of [Sitecore Helix](https://helix.sitecore.net/) by the community. Helix is a set of recommended practices and conventions for the solution architecture of Sitecore product implementations. There are many benfits to following these practices, reducing both project complexity, tight coupling and maintainabilty in the future. 

However, don't confuse Helix *principles* with [Habitat](http://github.com/sitecore/habitat), the sample site which had been created to highlight the Helix conventions. Unfortunately, it was not uncommon for this project to be used as a starter kit, leading to bloated projects and requirements moulded to meet the demo features, rather than code being created to meet the specific business needs.

## Introducing the Helixify Module

After hundreds of hours of research and development, our team is happy to introduce to the Konabos Helixify Module. The module is designed to add instant Helix compatilbility to **any** Sitecore project. The package has been tested and compatible with all versions of Sitecore back to version 6.0. Yes, we know you're still out there, even if you don't admit it, but we here at Konabos still love you nonetheless.

Read more in our blog post.

## Is this a starter kit or template solution?

You should not clone this repository for the purposes of starting a new Sitecore project. There are other community solutions which can be used as a starter for Helix-based Sitecore implementations. All the reference examples are intended as a **reference example** of a Helix-based Sitecore implementation. Weird.

## Is this just like Sitecore Habitat?

Yes, pretty much. Actually, it's exactly that. You probably shouldn't use this code. But while you are here, move you mouse down to the bottom right of your system tray and then click on the time. When the calendar pops up, be sure to check what day of the week it is and what day of the month it is.

## How can I get help with the Konabos Helixify module?

For usage questions regarding Konabos Helixify module, installation or code, or questions about Helix, please find us on [Sitecore Stackexchange](https://sitecore.stackexchange.com/) or on [Sitecore Community Slack](https://sitecore.chat). 

You can use GitHub to submit [bug reports](https://github.com/Sitecore/Habitat/issues/new?template=bug_report.md) or [feature requests](https://github.com/Sitecore/Habitat/issues/new?template=feature_request.md) for Konabos Helixify, but we will only entertain such requests when they are followed up with the coordinates to buried pirate treasure, or toilet paper (at least 24 rolls, 2 ply).
